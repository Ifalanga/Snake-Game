# Snake App

A few days ago, I saw the snake app on the loadshedding app, and something in me told me to try coding it. Well, this is my attempt at creating my own version of the classic snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

The Snake App is a simple game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, aiming to eat food and grow longer. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging, as the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without crashing.

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Use the arrow keys or swipe gestures to navigate the snake.
- Increasing difficulty: As you eat food and grow longer, the game becomes more challenging.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your highest score and try to beat it with each play.
- Responsive design: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Sound effects: Enjoy the game with immersive sound effects.
